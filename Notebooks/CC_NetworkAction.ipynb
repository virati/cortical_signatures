    "This work addresses a key need in adaptive DBS by characterizing our ability to control the brain's state, which is necessary for us to be able to go from a starting brain state $x_0$ (associated with depression) to a desired brain state $x_\\text{target}$ (associated with health).\n",

    "To do this we analyse a combination of SCC-LFP and scalp dEEG measured during experiments where we stimulate at either the patient-specific SCCwm target (ONTarget) or 1.5mm away (OFFTarget)."
