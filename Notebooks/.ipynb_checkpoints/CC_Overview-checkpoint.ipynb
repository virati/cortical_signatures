    "What exactly does DBS do to neural dynamics?\n",
    "Using clinical recordings of macro-level electrophysiology (field potentials), we can start to answer this question.\n",

    "\n",
    "To address the core question of the causal, network-level effects of SCCwm-DBS, we focused on four objectives.\n",
    "First, we want to understand what parts of our observed signals are different between SCCwm DBS, DBS elsewhere, and NoDBS.\n",
    "Next, we want to develop a way to classify this effect.\n",
    "Third, we want to understand how DBS modulates oscillatory coordination across\n",
    "Finally, we want to characterize the dynamics present in the brain's response to DBS.\n",
