    "# Cortical Control of SCCwm-DBS\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "*The publication associated with this work is available as a pre-print [here]().*\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanistic effects of SCCwm-DBS, and how they eventually lead to antidepressant activity, remains unclear.\n",
    "Using a novel combination of neural recordings from TRD patients treated with SCCwm-DBS, we can begin to answer this question.\n",
    "In this notebook we'll develop a network-level model for how SCCwm-DBS affects neural dynamics, specifically *oscillations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Efforts to *optimize* therapy are growing but a clearer idea of how DBS modulates, or couples into, the brain's dynamics is needed.\n",
    "If, for example, depression arises from activity that is far from the DBS probe, we need to either find a way to modulate that activity indirectly or implant another DBS probe into that region directly.\n",
    "Our data-driven model can serve as a preliminary *control model* for an adaptive DBS strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-Notebooks\n",
    "* Network Action [link]()\n",
    "* Effected Control Modes [link]()\n",
    "* Target engagement classification [link]()\n",
    "* EEG Support Modeling for Mechanism Dissection [link]()\n",

    "### System Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "![](System diagram and relationship of interest)\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus in this study is to understand the relationship between DBS at our target (SCCwm) and the measured oscillatory change in both SCC-LFP and EEG.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y_\\text{ephys} | g_\\text{target}(x); A*u_f(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $A$ is the stimulation amplitude, $u_f(t)$ is the stimulation waveform at frequency $f = 130\\Hz$, and $g_\\text{target}$ is the coupling function into the brain network being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the core question of the causal, network-level effects of SCCwm-DBS, we focused on four objectives.\n",
    "First, we want to understand what parts of our observed signals are different between SCCwm DBS, DBS elsewhere, and NoDBS.\n",
    "Next, we want to develop a way to classify this effect.\n",
    "Third, we want to understand how DBS modulates oscillatory coordination across\n",
    "Finally, we want to characterize the dynamics present in the brain's response to DBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Action\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Schematic of the different possible *network actions* for SCCwm-DBS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Network dynamics is associated with both *structure* and *function*.\n",
    "Structurally: do we modulate *local* activity in the SCC immediately around the stimulating electrode, the *remote* activity in cortical regions far away from the stimulation, a combination of both, or neither (null)? What is the *network* we are modulating with stimulation?\n",
    "Functionally: How does stimulation change neural dynamics, which we'll assume is captured in the *oscillations* of the brain? Do we decouple brain regions, increase noise, or somehow add in information? How are we *acting* on the brain network underlying depression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The *network action* remains unclear but a combination of intracranial LFP and scalp EEG can helps us better determine what brain regions are immediate affected by SCCwm-DBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This subproject notebook is available [here]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Modes\n",
    "Next, we'll characterize the *control modes* of SCCwm-DBS by performing a dimensionality reduction on our dEEG oscillatory responses.\n",
    "We'll identify coordinated changes in oscillatory bands and the dEEG channels where these changes occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Classification\n",
    "Being able to objectively confirm adequate target engagement is important to ensure standardized implementation and study of therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This subproject notebook is available [here]().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response Dynamics\n",
    "The brain's response to stimulation is likely *dynamic* or a function of time.\n",
    "Our measured brain responses support the idea of a dynamic response that captures important information about the network dynamics being modulated.\n",
    "This subproject notebook is available [here]().\n",
