# Cortical Signatures of SCCwm-DBS

## Overview
DBS of the SCCwm alleviates symptoms of depression, but its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear.
In this repository I address the question: what does SCCwm-DBS do immediately to brain dynamics?

## Requirements
This repository requires the custom library ```DBSpace```.

## Network Action
Characterization of the network action is done in two parts: spatial modes and temporal modes.

### Spatial Modes
WIP


### Temporal Modes
With an eye towards temporal changes, we studied the immediate effects of SCCwm-DBS on the trajectory of whole brain oscillatory activity.
