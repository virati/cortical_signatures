# Cortical Signatures of SCCwm-DBS

## Overview
This is the code related to the third aim of my thesis where I try to characterize the immediate whole-brain effects of SCCwm-DBS on oscillatory dynamics.
I then develop an EEG-based classifier that can confirm adequate *target engagement*.

Head on over to the notebook for a more complete [overview](Notebooks/CC_Overview.ipynb)

## Overview

The overall goal here is to better understand how DBS in the SCC, specifically targeted at individualized SCCwm, changes the dynamics in the brain.
This change in dynamics is likely related to the long-term efficacy of treatment.

Using a combination of invasive and noninvasive neural recordings, I identified the specific oscillatory pattern evoked by SCCwm DBS on whole-brain network activity.
Focusing specifically on $\alpha$ oscillations, we see that SCCwm DBS evokes a specific response that is easily differentiated from identical stimulation at a nearby electrode.

I then used the per-patient tractography to dissect out the immediate and secondary effects of SCCwm DBS.
