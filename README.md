# Cortical Signatures of SCCwm-DBS

## Overview
This is the code related to the third aim of my thesis where I try to characterize the immediate whole-brain effects of SCCwm-DBS on oscillatory dynamics.
I then develop an EEG-based classifier that can confirm adequate *target engagement*.

Head on over to the notebook for a more complete [overview](Notebooks/CC_Overview.ipynb)
